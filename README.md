# project
This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning-based system for identifying and classifying heart diseases in an e-healthcare environment. The project leverages patient data (such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other clinical parameters) to predict the presence and severity of heart disease using classification models.

Features
Data Preprocessing:
Cleaning and preparing raw patient data.
Handling missing values and outliers.
Machine Learning Models:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Model Evaluation:
Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
Confusion matrix and ROC curve analysis.
Visualization:
Graphs and charts for data distribution and model performance.
Web Application (Optional):
A Flask/Django-based web interface to input patient data and view predictions.
Tech Stack
Languages: Python
Libraries:
NumPy, Pandas (Data Manipulation)
Scikit-Learn (ML Models)
Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)
Flask/Django (Web Interface)
Dataset:
UCI Heart Disease Dataset or Kaggle Heart Disease Prediction Dataset
